# Dotfiles for i3wm on Ubuntu
This repository contains my personal dotfiles for configuring i3wm on Ubuntu. These files have been carefully crafted to enhance the functionality and aesthetic of the i3 window manager.

# Installation
To use these dotfiles, clone the repository to your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Then, create symlinks for the dotfiles in the repository to your home directory:

```bash
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/i3 ~/.i3
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/i3status ~/.i3status
```

Finally, restart i3 for the changes to take effect

# Customization
Feel free to customize these dotfiles to suit your needs. They are well-commented and easy to modify.

# Disclaimer
Use these dotfiles at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage caused by their use. Always make sure to backup your original dotfiles before making any changes.
